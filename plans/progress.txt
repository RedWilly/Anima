IMPLEMENTED PRD ITEM #-0: Project Initialization
- Initialized git repository and base directory structure.
- Configured core environment with TypeScript, bun, @napi-rs/canvas and fontkit.
- Created plans/prd.json with the feature roadmap.
- Basic package.json and tsconfig.json are verified and ready.
- Initial project typecheck passed.

IMPLEMENTED PRD ITEM #1: Vector2 Implementation
- Created `src/core/math/Vector2.ts` with basic vector operations (add, subtract, multiply, dot, length, normalize, lerp).
- Implemented static constants (ZERO, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- Created `tests/core/math/Vector2.test.ts` with comprehensive tests.
- Updated PRD to reflect completion of Vector2 items.

IMPLEMENTED PRD ITEM #2 & #3: Matrix3x3 Implementation
- Created `src/core/math/Matrix3x3.ts` with affine transformation support (multiply, transformPoint, inverse).
- Implemented static factories (translation, rotation, scale, shear) and identity.
- Added type-safe implementation using local variables to handle `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
- Created `tests/core/math/Matrix3x3.test.ts` covering all requirements.        
- Updated PRD to reflect completion of Matrix3x3 items.

Next: Color class implementation.
IMPLEMENTED PRD ITEM #4 & #5: Color Implementation
- Created src/core/math/Color.ts with support for RGBA, Hex, HSL, and constants.
- Created tests/core/math/Color.test.ts.
- Passed all tests and type checks.
- Addressed noUncheckedIndexedAccess strictness.

Next: BezierPath implementation.

Implemented BezierPath construction methods (moveTo, lineTo, quadTo, cubicTo, closePath) and added tests.

Implemented BezierPath analysis methods (getLength, getPointAt, getTangentAt) and added tests.

IMPLEMENTED PRD ITEM #8: BezierPath Morphing Operations
- Implemented `getPoints(n)` and `getPointCount()`.
- Implemented `toCubic()` to normalize paths to cubic curves.
- Implemented `matchPoints` to equalize point counts via curve subdivision (de Casteljau).
- Implemented `interpolate` to morph between two compatible paths.
- Added comprehensive tests covering these features.
- All tests passed.

IMPLEMENTED PRD ITEM #10, #11, #12: Mobject Base Class Implementation
- Created `src/mobjects/Mobject.ts` with transformation matrix support.
- Implemented `pos`, `show`, `hide`, and `applyMatrix` methods.
- Implemented getters for `position`, `rotation`, `scale`, and `opacity`.
- Created `src/mobjects/index.ts` to export Mobject.
- Created `tests/mobjects/Mobject.test.ts` with comprehensive tests for state and transformations.
- Verified type safety and test coverage.
- Updated PRD to reflect completion of Mobject Base Class items.

Next: VMobject implementation.
